Analysis of Model Predictions
=============================

1. Overall Performance
   Total samples predicted: 485
   Average confidence: 75.36%

2. Class Distribution
   tired: 172 (35.46%)
   hungry: 162 (33.40%)
   discomfort: 63 (12.99%)
   belly_pain: 59 (12.16%)
   burping: 29 (5.98%)

3. Confidence Analysis
   The box plot 'confidence_boxplot.png' visualizes the distribution of confidence scores for each predicted class:
   - The box represents the interquartile range (IQR) containing the middle 50% of the data.
   - The line in the box is the median confidence score.
   - The whiskers extend to show the rest of the distribution, excluding outliers.
   - Points beyond the whiskers are outliers.

   Interpretation:
   - Higher median (middle line) indicates higher overall confidence for that class.
   - Smaller boxes suggest more consistent confidence scores.
   - Longer whiskers or many outliers suggest more variability in confidence.

4. Insights and Recommendations
   - Classes with consistently high confidence scores may be well-represented in the training data.
   - Classes with low or highly variable confidence might need more or more diverse training samples.
   - Consider reviewing samples with very low confidence scores to understand potential misclassifications.
   - If a class has much lower confidence than others, it may indicate an imbalance in the training data.
